Each of the services in this list have been tested and has been confirmed that they work. 

This list was made because many people want free follower and likes but if you go on YouTube or somthing, you most likely get a site which is scam or you have to give your Instagram username and password, which is a really bad idea because those services use your account without you knowing.

## Information

| Icon | Meaning|
|------|--------|
|✅    |Email verification needed|
|📝    |Has some notes you should read|

For email verification, it is recomended to use https://temp-mail.org

The number in the square brackets (e.g [50]), are the number of likes/followers the service give you for free.

Sometimes, you can only use a service only once and when you try with another account, it will say that you have
already used the service so you cant use it anymore. To bypass this, use a VPN. A recomended VPN is [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/?friend=10yrk8b4)


**WARNING:** Use these services very carefully. If you use all of them on the same account one after the other in a short period of time, there might be risk of the account getting temporarly banned from getting any likes of just banned in general.
